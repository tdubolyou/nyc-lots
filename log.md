-I need to remove the excess data.  MAkes the Jsons clean and minimal.  
Before I do this I need to validate the data - validate the density factors
NOt gunning for perfection.  I don t know enough to be perfect.  Its an exploration, a chance to learn.  What else should go into this?
Steps - validate the density factors:
    remove outliers
    ask gpt to review highest density
    recalculate units based on reduced density factors
    confirm lot area in hectare


Th elot area in the PLUTO database is bullshit, also th3 units are bullshit - mostly wrong in projects where the builddings spread over multiple sites.  The total units are reported multiple times across different lots.  Would beed to aggregate by project.  removing anything over 800 units/HA.
